.SH NAME
simple_shell \- A simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that mimics the behavior of standard UNIX shells. It reads user commands, parses them, and then executes them as if they were entered in a standard shell.

.B simple_shell
handles the execution of built-in commands such as \fBexit\fR and \fBenv\fR, as well as external commands found in the system via the PATH variable. The shell supports process management, basic error handling, and argument parsing.

.SH OPTIONS
.B simple_shell
takes no command-line options. It operates interactively by default, waiting for user input in a loop until the user exits the shell.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following commands are built into
.B simple_shell :

.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell. Usage:
.I "exit [status]"
Exits the shell with the specified status. If no status is given, the shell closes with the status of the last executed command.

.TP
.B env
Displays the current environment variables. Usage:
.I "env"
Prints all available environment variables.

.SH USAGE

When
.B simple_shell
is launched, it displays a prompt where the user can enter commands. The shell then executes the command and returns to the prompt.

For example:

.EX
$ simple_shell
